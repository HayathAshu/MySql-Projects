# 🛒Zepto Inventory Management – MySQL Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **MySQL-based inventory management analysis** built using the **Zepto Inventory Dataset** from Kaggle.  
The goal of the project is to design a structured database, perform data cleaning, and run meaningful SQL queries to extract business insights related to product inventory, pricing, and availability.

## 📂 Dataset Information
- **Dataset Name:** Zepto Inventory Dataset  
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Dataset Link:**  
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/palvinder2006/zepto-inventory-dataset  

The dataset contains product-level inventory details such as:
- Product name  
- Category  
- Price and discount  
- Availability status  
- Quantity  
- Other inventory-related attributes  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Query Language:** SQL  
- **Dataset Format:** CSV  
- **IDE / Client:** MySQL Workbench  

---

## 🗄️ Database Design
- Created a dedicated database for Zepto inventory data
- Designed tables with appropriate data types
- Applied constraints such as `PRIMARY KEY`, `NOT NULL`, and `DEFAULT`
- Ensured clean and structured schema for efficient querying

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
The following steps were performed:
- Removed or handled NULL values
- Corrected data types for numeric and categorical columns
- Standardized column values where required
- Ensured consistency across product categories and pricing fields

---

## 🔍 SQL Queries & Analysis
Some of the key analyses performed:
- Total number of products available
- Category-wise product distribution
- Products with highest and lowest prices
- Discounted vs non-discounted product analysis
- Inventory availability insights
- Aggregate calculations using `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`
- Filtering using `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY`
